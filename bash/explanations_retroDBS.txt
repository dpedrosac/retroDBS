# Explanation of the analysis pipeline for retroDBS


# Step 1: Create a study specific template if needed (./bash/retroDBS_createStudySpecificTemplate.sh)
# Step 2: Create a skull-stripped version of the SST (./bash/retroDBS_processingSST.sh)
# Step 3: Extract DICOM content to nifti files; all necessary sequences for the MRI are selected and the rest is deleted (./bash/retroDBS_dcm2nii.sh)
# Step 4: Deface and anonimise data in general so that no patient specific information may be found (./bash/retroDBS_dcm2nii.sh or ./bash/retroDBS_defaceStandalone.sh)
# Step 5: Register all MR-sequences to 'common space' (./bash/retroDBSintrasubject_registration.sh) 

# Further steps outside bash: VTA were generated using LeadDBS with the pre- and postoperative imaging and using the FastField algorithm (./data/VTA/). Besides, a different segmentation of the STN was obtained using the algorithms from Ximing Xiao (./data/segmentationPD25/). Finally, preoperative planning was obtained from the planning software along with the segmentation of the imaging (./data/preoperative_planningDCM), converted in a NIFTI-file (./data/preoperative_planningNIFTI)

# Step5: Bringing anatomy (t1/VTA) into same space, i.e. anat_t1 (leadDBS) -> MNI (./bash/retroDBS_coregistrationAtlasTx.sh)
# Step6: Bringing preopertaive NIFTI into same space, i.e. preoperativeNIFTI (neurosurgery) -> MNI (./bash/retroDBS_coregistrationPreoperative.sh)
# Step7: Bringing segmentation into same space, i.e. PD25 -> MNI (./bash/retroDBS_coregistrationPD25.sh)

# "======================================================================"
# Definitions of space, etc. at this point
# ./data/PD25/subj_{x}/						-> MNI space -> ICBM152-2009c_symmetric (Step 7)
# ./data/VTA/subj_{x}/atlas_t_{1/2}.nii.gz			-> native space -> ICBM152-2009c_symmetric (Step 5)
# ./data/preoperative_planningNIFTI/subj_{x}			-> native space -> ICBM152-2009c_symmetric (Step 5)
# ./data/VTA/subj_{x}/stimulations_retroDBS/vat_left.nii.gz	-> MNI space
# "======================================================================"

# Step 8: Align preoperative data with the rest, i.e. dice coefficient (./bash/retroDBS_diceAnalyses.sh)
